His successor Martin Vizcarra wouldn't have a great term either, and would suffer a successful Proceso de Vacancia which ultimately saw him removed from office, then Merino became President and had to resign five days later amid protests.
It would be on that context that the electionary cycle would commence, unsurprisingly the coalition created by Kuczynksi collapsed and that meant whoever was to become the face of the Anti-Fujimorista movement would not be someone associated with the administration of turn. And the one who would finish first during the first round, and would move to a run-off against Keiko Sofia Fujimori, would be Pedro Castillo, a syndicalist leader who lead the protests during la huelga magisterial of 2017. This election is however very controversial for many motives, not just the ideological contrast of the candidates.
The greatest fear is that, just as seen by Aliaga during the first round, the candidates may reject the results were they to lose.</p>","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/semanaeconomica.bucket/semanaeconomica2/articles/banner/29992_1618266192_banner.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":1,"advisor_url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1272916298482225152/9QSwQWmN_400x400.jpg","recommended_reading":"","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":20,"year":2016,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"2021PE"}];e.credits = "Chich0w0 (coding and main writer), SpaceNerd4 (ortography)";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":200,"fields":{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"Castillo","election":20,"party":"Free Peru","state":"Cajamarca","priority":1,"description":"Castillo is a school teacher from Cajamarca.
