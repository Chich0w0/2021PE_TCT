The presidential election, which determined the president and the vice presidents, required a run-off between the two top candidates, which was held on 6 June. The congressional elections determined the composition of the Congress of Peru, with all 130 seats contested. The election experienced increased political polarization, with conservative parties embracing far-right politics and the media in Peru attacking left-wing candidates. After a contested first round, Castillo managed to win, followed by Keiko Fujimori in second. Which one will win this time? We'll see. Ah, and the election integrity or the possibility of a massive fraud will play a crucial role in this election. Good luck to both candidates!</p>","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/semanaeconomica.bucket/semanaeconomica2/articles/banner/29992_1618266192_banner.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":1,"advisor_url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1272916298482225152/9QSwQWmN_400x400.jpg","recommended_reading":"","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":20,"year":2016,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"2021PE"}];e.credits = "Chich0w0 (coding and main writer), SpaceNerd4 (ortography), Astro (secondary coder)";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":200,"fields":{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"Castillo","election":20,"party":"Free Peru","state":"Cajamarca","priority":1,"description":"Castillo is a school teacher from Cajamarca.
