His successor Martin Vizcarra wouldn't have a great term either, and would suffer a successful Proceso de Vacancia which ultimately saw him removed from office, then Merino became President and had to resign five days later amid protests. It would be on that context that the electionary cycle would commence, unsurprisingly the coalition created by Kuczynksi collapsed and that meant whoever was to become the face of the Anti-Fujimorista movement would not be someone associated with the administration of turn. And the one who would finish first during the first round, and would move to a run-off against Keiko Sofia Fujimori, would be Pedro Castillo, a syndicalist leader who lead the protests during the huelga magisterial of 2017. This election is however very controversial for many motives, not just the ideological contrast of the candidates. The greatest fear is that, just as seen by Aliaga during the first round, the candidates may reject the results were they to lose.</p>","image_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/semanaeconomica.bucket/semanaeconomica2/articles/banner/29992_1618266192_banner.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":1,"advisor_url":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1272916298482225152/9QSwQWmN_400x400.jpg","recommended_reading":"","has_visits":1,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":20,"year":2016,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"2021PE"}];e.credits = "Chich0w0 (coding and main writer), SpaceNerd4 (ortography)";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":200,"fields":{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"Castillo","election":20,"party":"Free Peru","state":"Cajamarca","priority":1,"description":"José Pedro Castillo Terrones is one of the most prominent figures of the Syndicalist movement in the entire country.

That suffering, of a working-class man, would follow him for his entire life.But despite all the difficulties, he nevertheless managed to get a bachelor's degree at Universidad César Vallejo. From 1995, he worked as a teacher at Institución Educativa Primaria No. 10465 in his town. During this time, he became a leader in the labor movement in the Provincia de Chota. With his relentless effort, he became the President of the Comité de Lucha of SUTEP for his region and later the General Secretary of FENATEP. It was in this context that he rose to national prominence as the 2017 Huelga Magisterial began. It was during that time that Carlos Basombrío Iglesias accused him of being related to Sendero Luminoso, which Castillo denied, but the right would continue to accuse him of it at the time, and that accusation would persist.","color_hex":"#ff0000","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/937891509183848489/1128504290399490068/castillo.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>Congrats!

She is the daughter of former President and dictator Alberto Fujimori. During her father's days in power, she spent her first 2 years studying business administration in New York. However, that came to an end in 1994 when her parents got divorced, and she became the youngest first lady of the Republic. After her father was forced to resign and leave the country, she spent a few years in Congress before becoming the main figure of Fuerza Popular.Fuerza Popular has represented, from the start, both her and her father. First, she faced Ollanta Humala in 2011 and lost in the second round. Then, she faced Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2016 and lost in the second round as well. Later, she was jailed under accusations of corruption; nevertheless, she was granted a habeas corpus and was set free.Now, she faces Castillo in the second round. But even if the bad memories may persist, she is confident that this time things will be different. Not only was the last President a total failure, but even his followers know it. Furthermore, her opponent is an extremist, making her ideas appear more democratic and respectable to the common man than those of the people who hate her. However, one is left to question if that will be enough to bring her the victory she failed to achieve 5 and 10 years ago. <b>(NOT PLAYABLE FOR NOW)</b>","color_hex":"#ffae00","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/937891509183848489/1128502694332608553/kf.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>Placeholder</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>SORRY, YOU HAVE LOST!</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":202,"fields":{"first_name":"Dina","last_name":"Boluarte","election":20,"party":"Free Peru","state":"Apurímac","priority":1,"description":"'","color_hex":"#ff0000","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":0,"image_url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/937891509183848489/1129106155545829426/Dina_Boluarte_28202129.png","electoral_victory_message":"'","electoral_loss_message":"'","no_electoral_majority_message":"'","description_as_running_mate":"Born on May 31st, 1962, Dina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra is a lawyer from Apurímac.
